Our dependent variable, Ln(Total Pay), is the natural logarithm of the firmâ€™s CEO expected total compensation, calculated as the sum of salary, discretionary bonus, the target value of non- equity incentives, the grant-date value of restricted stock, performance shares, and stock options, and other compensation (including perquisites, signing bonuses, termination payments, above- market interest paid on deferred compensation). We exclude from our analysis all observations from 16 CEOs with total pay less than one dollar per month at some point during our sample period, based on the premise that such pay is objectively symbolic and not the outcome of a competitive managerial labor market. This exclusion is important for our analysis (and for many other analyses using the logarithm of total pay as the dependent variable); the issues and implications of this exclusion, and results from alternative methodologies addressing such outlier observations (and whether, indeed, they are outliers), are discussed in detail in Appendix B.
